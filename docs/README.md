# Docs

Project documentation: plans, checklists, guides, and decisions.

**Start here:** [**copilot_prd.md**](copilot_prd.md) — product requirements and decisions in one place; update it as we build so the whole app is easy to understand.

**Convention:** Add new docs here when it makes sense—e.g. after a non-obvious decision, when setting up a new system (auth, deploy, etc.), or when something would be easy to forget later.
